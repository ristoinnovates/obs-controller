## Features

- **20 Programmable Mechanical Switches**: Fully customizable for switching scenes or controlling other OBS functions.
- **3 Sliding Potentiometers (10K)**: Ideal for volume control, transitions, or other analog inputs.
- **3 LEDs**: Visual indicators for scene changes or active status.
- **3 Pushbuttons**: Additional programmable control options.
- **3 220 Ohm Resistors**: Ensure proper current flow to the LEDs.
- **Display (SPI Protocol)**: Provides live feedback on scenes, settings, or transitions.
- **Custom 3D Printed Enclosure**: Built to house all components securely with a top and bottom enclosure.
- **Powered by Arduino Pro Micro**: The core component, handling all the processing for the controller.
